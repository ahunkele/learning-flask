# Notes: #

    **Rest Principles**

    * Going to a site does a GET/Post Request.
    * Can return HTML or others like JSON/XML

    **Rest API**

    * it's a way of thinking how a web server responds to one's requests.
    * Responds with resources (like data)
    * The server has resources, and each is able to interact with the pertinent request

    **Rest is Stateless**

    * A key feature of REST is it is supposed to be Stateless
    * One request cannot depend on any other requests.
    * Server should only know about the current request, and not previous requests.
